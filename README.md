This app is created using React Vite and uses Prettier for code formatting. 

What I have learnt

Moved state to the parent to use in parallel child component
Do not overuse state. If it is just needed locally use const or let variable.
Used React Vite to create React app and generating built package and deployed via Github Actions.
Used Destructuring to pass parameters between parent and child components.
Used local function component to remove redundant code.
